# Report-Hoboken

## How to Run
1. Ensure that you have MongoDB as well as Node.js installed.
2. You must have a Google Maps API key in a ```.env``` in both the client and the server. You can obtain a key from [here](https://developers.google.com/maps) if one was not provided to you.  
3. In the source directory, do ```cd server``` and then ```npm install```. Once everything is installed, run ```npm run seed``` to seed the database and ```npm start``` to run the server. If everything was done correctly, you should see ```Your routes will now be running on http://localhost:4000 outputted``` in the console.
4. Open another terminal in the source directory and do ```cd client``` and then ```npm install```. Once everything is installed, run ```npm start``` and it should redirect you to the home page.
